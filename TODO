 - test on various drivers (AMD, Nvidia, Intel)
 - where > 1 driver exists, persist choice
 - Expand beyond lambdas in order to support, eg,
   this algo: http://photomonkee.com/blog/2012/03/15/edge-detection-in-opencl/
    + basic conversion seems to work
    + if/then
    + for and while loops
    + possibly unfixable: python short-circuit and/or, eg, x = foo or 10
      this is syntactically correct in C, but won't work as expected
    + types aren't supported yet -- everything defaults to float.
      some minimal type inference is needed
    + closures are currently supported via a @bindings parameter b/c
      the namespace of the function isn't accessible via inspect()
      this is probably unfixable
